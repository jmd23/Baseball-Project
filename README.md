# Baseball-Project
The purpose of this project was twofold: first, to determine the effect of external factors (temperature, wind speed, crowd size, etc...) on "internal" components of a baseball game. (game duration, runs scored, etc..). Finally, using the Kaggle dataset and Scikit-Learn, various machine learning models were implemented to predict the winner of the baseball game. This project was done as a part of the Cornell Sports Analytics Club during the Fall 2021 semester (and subsequently added to since), and served as an interesting application of data science and machine learning for us.
